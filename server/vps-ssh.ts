// SSH connection sharing for the VPS computer, supplied by the app.
//
// Every VPS action is `docker -H ssh://alias …`, and the live desktop is an
// SSH port forward. Docker's SSH transport runs whatever `ssh` it finds on
// PATH with the user's own ~/.ssh/config, so without ControlMaster in that
// alias every command pays a full handshake — several hundred milliseconds
// each, on every preview frame and every click. The guide asks people to add
// the block; nothing checked, and the ones who missed it saw a computer that
// "connected but was slow". This module makes the alias irrelevant: a config
// that includes theirs first (so anything they set still wins) and fills in
// connection sharing and fail-fast timeouts, plus an `ssh` shim docker finds
// ahead of the real one that points at that config.

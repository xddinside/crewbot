 * **The invariant: the Activity is finishing before the credential is handed to
 * anything that outlives it.**
 *
 * `noHistory` and `persistNever` are not enough on their own. Between the moment
 * the URL reaches `Session` — which holds it in a long-lived `StateFlow` the UI
 * reads — and the moment `finish()` marks the record, there is a window in which
 * the process can die while the system still holds a *newly launched,
 * non-finishing* `ActivityRecord`. AOSP preserves such a record and relaunches it
 * with its original Intent, credential and all, which is exactly the redelivery
 * this trampoline exists to prevent. `finish()` is a synchronous call into the
 * system server, so once it returns the record is marked finishing and no
 * relaunch can bring the Intent back.
 *
 * So: relaunch, mark finishing, and only then deliver.
